##ISSUES WITH SCENARIO                                           
##Feature: Ssearching

1 I want to be able to search the site

2 So that I can find information I am looking for

3 Given http://www.clearchannelinterntional.com/

4 When I go to the header

5 And I click on the icon on the right which will let me search

6 And I enter test

7 And I click the search button on the right of the search field

8 And the search executes


  HOW TO IMPROVE
1 Spelt incorectly- should be Searching
2 I will write "As a user of the site"
3 I will break it down "I want to be able to search, so that I can find the   information I am looking for
4 I will write " Given I navigate" to indicate what I want to do.
5 Not necesaary bacause header is displayed on navaigation
6 Too Long
7 Spelt incorectly- should be text
8 Too Long,
9 I will use "Then" for assertion
