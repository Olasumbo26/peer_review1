  #HOW TO IMPROVE
* Spelt incorectly- should be Searching
* I will write "As a user of the site"
* I will break it down "I want to be able to search, so that I can find the   information I am looking for
* I will write " Given I navigate" to indicate what I want to do.
* Not necesaary bacause header is displayed on navaigation
* Too Long
* Spelt incorectly- should be text
* Too Long,
* I will use "Then" for assertion
